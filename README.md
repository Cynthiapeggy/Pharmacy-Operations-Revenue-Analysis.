# Pharmacy-Operations-Revenue-Analysis.
## Project Overview
This project analyzes pharmacy sales data using Microsoft Excel to uncover revenue trends, top-performing drugs, and customer purchasing behavior. The dashboard provides interactive insights to support inventory management, supplier performance tracking, and sales optimization decisions.

## Dataset used

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
There are six KPI cards to highlight the most important pharmacy metrics:
- Total Revenue
- Total Transactions
- Avg Sales per
- Total Quantity Sold
- Revenue per Unit
- Average Unit Price

These KPI cards automatically update when filtered using slicers, making them dynamic and highly responsive.
## Interactive Charts and Visualizations
To provide clearer insights, I added multiple charts powered by PivotTables:
- Sales by Drug Category
Sales by drug category highlight revenue distribution across medication types, revealing top-performing categories and demand-driven product segments.
- Monthly Sales Trend
Monthly sales trend analysis tracks revenue performance over time, identifying growth patterns, seasonal fluctuations, and periods of increased or reduced demand.
- Drugs by Quantity
Drugs by quantity analysis shows the volume of units sold per medication, highlighting best-selling products and inventory demand patterns.
- Sales by Supplier
Sales by supplier analysis evaluates revenue contribution from each supplier, helping identify top-performing suppliers and optimize procurement strategies.
- Payment Method Analysis
Payment method analysis examines sales distribution across payment types, revealing customer preferences and guiding transaction processing and revenue strategies.

This chart illustrates the distribution of sales across different customer types (e.g., Walk-in, HMO, Hospital Referral). Each chart is clearly labeled, color-coded, and dynamically adjusts when filters are applied for accurate, real-time insights.
## Slicers for Interactive Filtering
To make the dashboard truly dynamic, I added four slicers:
-	Prescription Type
-	Payment Method
-	Customer Type
-	Drug Category

With slicers, users can explore the Dashboard:
Slicers enable users to interactively explore the dashboard, filtering data by Prescription Type, Payment Method, Customer Type, or Drug Category. All KPIs and charts update instantly with slicer selections, creating a fully interactive and user-friendly experience.
